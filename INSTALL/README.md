Armored Software Installation
=============================

There are currently two scales of Armored Software installations envisioned for development.
- Small Desktop cloud
- Large Cluster Cloud 

Small Desktop Cloud
-------------------
The Small Desktop Cloud is expected to be setup in a developer's offce and
consist of 3 to 5 desktop computers. It is expected that a Small Desktop Cloud
will be used for experimental development that may required frequent access
to the cloud hardware. An example would be frequently kickstarting of the OS or
frequent network cable changes.

To install Armored Software on a Small Desktop Cloud look at the file ./smallDesktopCloud/README.md.

Large Cluster Cloud
-------------------
The Large Cluster Cloud is made up of blade cluster nodes and may consist of hundreds of computers.
